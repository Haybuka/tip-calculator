## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind Css
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

 During the course of this project, i got more reinforcement on the use of tailwindCss in projects and some quick hacks. Important to note is also passing functions about, and the use of memo to limit renders based on user calculations.

### Continued development

For continued development, i think i'd want to pay more attention to react Context and React use Reducers also. Understanding tailwind better also fits in this plan, but one at a time.
